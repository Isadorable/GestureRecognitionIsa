# Feedback and feedforward in temporal gesture models  

The purpose of this project was to create a dynamic-link library, suitable to be used with every kind of acquisition de-vice that supports a motion tracking system (e.g. MS Kinect). The information associated to body joints were used to build a solid feedback and feedforward system aimed to assist and guide the end users through the process of defining and learning new gestures. Three-dimensional continuous gestures could be easily defined in a compositional and de-clarative way, leveraging a context-free grammar and with the use of an event-based system for the recognition part. 

Includes Unity 5 integration
